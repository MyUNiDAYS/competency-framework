                            <p>This framework outlines examples of desirable behaviours and skills, arranged into
                                different high level competencies, finer grained topics and individual levels. It is a
                                tool that helps employees and managers:</p>

                            <p>The framework is a compass, not a GPS.</p>
                            <p>It's meant to be helpful. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge
                                cases.</p>

                            <p>The framework covers all the things we're looking for from each role at UNiDAYS. We have
                                a suite of core-competencies and then more specific ones for each role.</p>
                            <p>Each competency topic is sorted into levels and we try to give specific examples of
                                behaviours we expect for each.</p>
                            <p>Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind
                                closed doors. You'll agree what level of progression you're going for and what you need
                                to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you're doing relative to that at
                                all times.</p>

                        <div class="box-inner-container">
                            <ul>
                                <li>There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to UNiDAYS as you grow,
                                    including deep technical knowledge and ability, leadership and people management.
                                    All are equally valuable paths.</li>
                                <li>The framework represents a career's worth of progression, people shouldn't expect to
                                    fly up it in 18 months!</li>
                                <li>Progression isn't an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.</li>
                                <li>This isn't a checklist ‚Äì it's possible to progress up a level without showing all
                                    the behaviours in that level.</li>
                                <li>You can find some more information in these links. If that doesn't answer most of
                                    your questions, please ask your manager.</li>
                                <li>The skills/behaviours listed are a guide. The list is not exhaustive. Use it to have
                                    a understanding of what‚Äôs expected of you currently and what you can do to advance
                                    yourself.</p>
                                <li>In reviews with your line manager, both of you should review the skills/behaviours
                                    expected of you and identify missing/weaker areas to work on</p>
                                <li>The expected skills/behaviours form part of your performance reviews. It is expected
                                    within reviews that you can provide evidence/commentary (where not already implicit)
                                    for each skill/behaviour. You should certainly do this for the skills/behaviours
                                    you‚Äôve been working on</p>
                                <li>You should reflect on this framework regularly and track your skills/ behaviours</p>
